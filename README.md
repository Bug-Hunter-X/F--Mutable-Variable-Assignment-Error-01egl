# F# Mutable Variable Assignment Error

This example demonstrates a common error in F# where developers attempt to modify a variable declared with `let` which is immutable. This results in a compile-time error.

The `bug.fs` file shows the incorrect code and the `bugSolution.fs` file demonstrates the correct solution using the `mutable` keyword.
